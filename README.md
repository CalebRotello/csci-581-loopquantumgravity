# Simulating Spin-Foam Amplitudes in Loop Quantum Gravity

This is the repository for the project, originally started in CSCI581 by Caleb Rotello and Hakan Ayaz in Spring 2021. The `archived` directory is everything done that semester, left as-is in case it needs to be accessed again without dealing with Git's commit system.

+ `LQG` contains all of the code, with more specifics in each python file. 
+ `tutorial_lqg_2.ipynb` is a tutorial of how to use my (Caleb Rotello) code
